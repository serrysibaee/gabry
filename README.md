# gabry
This is a basic implementation of matrix and vectors library to make it understandable in the context of computational matrices 

## The needed understanding of the library is like this: 

### 1. Gabry is the required library the one that should be used to use others (so it is the imported one) 
### 2. khap6 3shwaa is a randomness library from scratch (still needs a lot of work) 
### 3. sho3a3 is a vector implementation to use as a basis for another library 
### 4. masfofah is a library for matrix operations 


## Using gabry library (examples)
